The Boeing 737 MAX case is an example of how engineering decisions can lead to serious ethical failures when safety is not treated as the top priority. Many of the problems did not come from a single mistake, but from multiple decisions made under cost, schedule, and competition pressure. These decisions affected how the MCAS system was designed, approved, documented, and communicated.

One major ethical issue was how the risks of MCAS were downplayed. MCAS was added to address changes in the aircraft’s aerodynamics, but it relied heavily on limited sensor input and could activate repeatedly without pilot command. Instead of treating MCAS as a safety-critical system, it was described as a minor software feature. By minimizing its importance, potential risks were not fully addressed early on, which increased the likelihood of failure.

Another important issue was the decision to leave MCAS out of pilot manuals and training. Boeing wanted the 737 MAX to require minimal additional training so airlines would not need to invest in simulators. As a result, pilots were not informed about MCAS or how to respond to its failures. This decision prioritized cost and market competitiveness over pilot awareness and passenger safety, limiting pilots’ ability to make informed decisions during emergencies.

After the crashes, responsibility was not handled appropriately. Initial responses often placed blame on pilots, even though pilots were not fully informed about MCAS or trained on how it worked. Pilots were expected to react correctly in high-stress situations without knowing the system existed or how aggressively it could behave. From an ethical perspective, responsibility should lie with the engineers, management, and regulators who made decisions about the system’s design and training requirements.

There were also ethical concerns related to the aircraft approval process. Boeing was allowed to self-certify parts of the 737 MAX, including MCAS, through delegated authority from the FAA. While this system is meant to speed up certification, it becomes problematic when companies face strong pressure to meet deadlines and reduce costs. Independent oversight is important for protecting public safety, especially when dealing with safety-critical systems.

Competition with Airbus and tight deadlines influenced many of these choices. The pressure to quickly release a competitive aircraft led to reliance on software fixes rather than larger design changes, as well as reduced testing and training requirements. While these pressures help explain why decisions were made, they do not justify compromising safety. Ethical engineering requires resisting pressure when it puts lives at risk.

Using the ASME Code of Ethics, the most important principle is that engineers must hold the safety, health, and welfare of the public paramount. In this case, safety was repeatedly deprioritized in favor of cost, schedule, and competition. Ethical conflicts should be resolved by choosing the option that best protects human life, even when it is more expensive or time-consuming. 

Overall, the Boeing 737 MAX case shows that ethical failures rarely come from one bad decision, but from many small compromises made under pressure. Preventing similar problems requires action at multiple levels, including individuals speaking up, organizations prioritizing safety, and systems that ensure independent oversight and transparency. This case shows that engineering ethics is not just about following rules, but about making responsible choices under real-world constraints through strong oversight, clear communication, and sound ethical judgment.
