## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I enjoy hands-on engineering and learning how mechanical systems work by using analysis, modeling, and lab testing. Through coursework and student engineering roles, I’ve gained experience working in instructional labs, setting up and testing equipment, building and repairing lab apparatus, and identifying issues in mechanical systems. I’ve also worked with engines and mechanical components, where I learned how to troubleshoot problems and think through design and performance limitations. My goal is to work as an engineer in the industry, where I can apply what I’ve learned to real systems, continue developing my technical skills, and gain more hands-on experience.
